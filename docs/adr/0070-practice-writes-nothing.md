# 70. Practice writes nothing

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-11-03
- Refers to: SPEC §3, §4.5; `docs/briefs/phase-3a.md` (slice 6); ADR 0006 (FSRS), ADR 0014 (the session), ADR 0028 (the log: undo and reset entries), ADR 0032 (retrievability), ADR 0035 (suspension), ADR 0037 (suspend and delete during review), ADR 0068 (archived decks), ADR 0069 (study scopes)

## Context

Once the day's cards are done, people want to go over a deck again before an exam or a lesson, or over the cards of one tag. The brief asks for **Practice** for a deck or a tag, offered on the "all done for today" status page and in the deck's ⋮ menu: cards in an order of the scheduler's choosing (lowest retrievability first), the same Fail and Pass, and **nothing written**: no review event and no change to any card. Undo just steps back; the summary says "Practice: nothing was rescheduled". A test must show the database byte-identical after a practice.

Why nothing may be written:

- **FSRS models memory from spaced recalls.** Each review updates stability and difficulty from the grade and the time elapsed since the last review (ADR 0006). A recall seconds or minutes after the last review (t ≈ 0) carries almost no information about memory: the card is still in short-term memory, so a Pass says nothing about how long it will be remembered. FSRS-6 has a short-term formula for same-day reviews, but fed with a burst of them it would raise stability (a string of easy Passes) or distort difficulty (Fails under time pressure), and push due dates away from where the user's real memory puts them.
- **The review log is the source of truth and append-only** (SPEC §3, ADR 0028): `card_schedule` is a cache rebuilt from it, triggers forbid changing it, and an undo is a new entry. Practice answers written there could never be removed, only cancelled one by one with undo entries, and every statistic (activity, pass rate, card information) would count them. A separate log kind ("practice") would need a migration, an export format change, and a rule in every reader to skip it, for answers that by design must not count.

## Decision

**Practice writes nothing, by construction.**

- The core's `scheduling::Practice` holds plain card ids, the queue and the answers in memory, and no store. Its `graded`, `undo_last`, `skip` and `put_back` are pure, and dropping it (the page closed, the app quit or crashed) leaves no trace.
- The only store call practice makes is `Store::practice_queue(&self, scope, now)`: a shared reference, one read transaction that commits nothing. The app reaches it through `AppState::practice_queue`, which takes a shared borrow of the store.
- On the review page, a practice runs a `Run::Practice` where a session runs a `Run::Study`. Fail and Pass go to `grade_practice` and Ctrl+Z (and the header's and the summary's Undo) to `undo_practice`: neither reads the page's `AppState`, so neither has a way to the database. `record_review` and `undo` are called only on the `Run::Study` path.
- **Tests**: a core test builds a database file with a history (reviews, an undo, a reset), opens a second connection, and then practises a deck and a tag through the store API the app calls, with fails, passes and undos. Afterwards the main file and the write-ahead log are byte-identical with the same modification times, a full table dump (every table, the search index's included, rowids and schema) is equal, the store's `total_changes` and the other connection's `PRAGMA data_version` (which changes when anyone commits) are unchanged; the same checks then see a single real answer, so they are not blind. The `-shm` index is left out of the byte comparison: it holds no data, and readers write their read marks there. Comparing the main file alone would not be meaningful in WAL mode, where a commit lands in the log first; checkpointing before comparing would itself write. A second test drops a practice part-way and checks the files, then closes and reopens the store and checks the dump. An app test runs a practice through the review page itself (reveal, Fail, Pass, Ctrl+Z, the summary's Undo) and checks the files, `data_version` and every card's log.

**The queue.** The live, unsuspended cards of the scope, in decks that are neither deleted nor archived (a tag's practice uses the tag session's own condition, ADR 0069; a deck's refuses an archived deck with `DeckArchived`, as studying does), due or not: practice ignores the schedule and the daily limits since it records nothing. Reviewed cards come first by their retrievability now, lowest first, computed as Card Information computes it (`stats::retrievability` from the cached stability, difficulty and last review, ADR 0032); then new cards, which have no memory state, oldest first. Ties break by card id, so the order is deterministic (`scheduling::practice::practice_order`, pure and tested).

**At most 50 cards** (`PRACTICE_LIMIT`). A practice is a short refresher of what is weakest, not a second pass over a deck of thousands; another practice starts from the top again. Fifty is about ten minutes at the usual pace.

**A Fail comes back in the same practice**, after three other cards (`RELEARN_GAP`; at the end when fewer are left, at once when it is the last): a short relearning in memory, which is what someone practising expects. A Pass ends the card. A card is queued at most once, so Undo is exact: the answered card is taken from wherever a Fail put it and shown next, and the summary loses the answer (property-tested: undoing every answer gives back the practice as it began).

**Entry points.** Practice is offered only when there is at least one card to practise (`practice_offered`, pure):
- on the summary after a session of a deck or a tag, both "Nothing to Study" and "Session Complete" (the day's cards are done either way): a secondary **Practice** pill (no `suggested-action`; Back keeps the focus and stays the suggested one) beside Back to Deck, in an `AdwWrapBox` that puts it under Back when a line cannot hold both. It replaces the finished session with a practice of the same deck or tag (`ui::nav::replace_visible`, `adw_navigation_view_replace` with the pages under it kept), so Back from the practice goes where Back from the session went; `shown` is still emitted for the new page (tested), which sets its focus there. It is not offered on a practice's own summary;
- in the deck page's Deck Menu, first, above Statistics, disabled while the deck has nothing to practise (read with the study counts);
- in each deck row's ⋮ menu on the deck list, in a section of its own above Rename…, disabled while the deck has no live unsuspended card (from the row's counts, no query). It pushes the practice over the deck list, whose summary button says "Back to Decks" (`StartedFrom::DeckList`).

A tag's practice is reached from its session's summary only; the brief asks for no other entry, and All Cards' header has no room for one.

**The page.** The same review page, layout and keys. What makes a practice unmistakable is an `AdwBanner` above the card, "Practice — nothing is rescheduled": the HIG's widget for a persistent state of a view, here without a button since there is nothing to do about it. The title stays the deck's name or "Tagged “verbs”" and the subtitle still counts what is left; the page's own title (screen readers, a Back button above it) is "Practice". Not overloaded further: no change of colours or buttons. On the summary the banner goes, since the summary says it in words: "Practice Complete", "Practice: nothing was rescheduled" (escaped, as every text put into `AdwStatusPage:description`), and two tiles, the cards practised and the pass rate (the time tile is left out, as the brief asks for those two; the summary then fits a phone at 360 × 640 without scrolling).

**Card actions during a practice.** Edit and Card Information stay: changing a card's text is not scheduling. Suspend, Move to Deck and Delete also stay and go through their normal paths, each with its own Undo toast (ADR 0037, 0064): they are changes the user asks for, not answers, and leaving them out would make the Card Menu differ between two pages that look the same. The card leaves the practice as it leaves a session. A deck archived during a tag's practice leaves it as it leaves a tag's session (ADR 0069).

## Consequences

- Practice never changes due dates, statistics or the log, so it can be used at any time without a second thought, and an interrupted practice needs no recovery.
- Nothing remembers a practice: its summary is the only record, and leaving the page forgets it.
- Suspend, Move and Delete during a practice do write, as everywhere else; the byte-identical guarantee is about answers and their Undo.
- The order needs the retrievability of every card of the scope, computed in Rust from one query; for 5,000 cards that is a few milliseconds.
