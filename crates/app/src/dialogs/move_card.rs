//! Move to Deck… for one card (#102): the choice of a deck, shared by the
//! deck page's card menu, All Cards' row menu and the review page's Card
//! Menu, and the Undo toast they all offer. The dialog itself is All Cards'
//! chooser (`browser_dialogs::choose_closing`, layout in `data/browser_dialogs.blp`);
//! the move and its Undo are core's `move_cards` and `unmove_cards` through
//! `AppState`. What each page does with the card afterwards (the row leaves
//! the list, the card leaves the session) is its own.
